** Ch.1 — Ash and Morning Light
:FOCUS: Establish home, grandparents, Aag’s awkwardness.
:TONE: Warm, rustic, lightly humorous, undercurrent of confinement.
:BEATS:
- Opening image: Morning mist on the Spinebreaker peaks, smoke curling from hearths, distant glow of volcanic fire. Aag hauling water or wood with his grandfather, Darshan.
- Darshan cracks jokes while working, complaining loudly about his “lazy bones” but outpacing Aag anyway. He insists on laughter to make labor lighter.
- Grandmother Shaila interrupts with her sharp tongue: correcting Darshan’s exaggerations, reminding Aag of discipline and respect for the old ways.
- Training yard: Aag sparring with peers. He insists on greatsword + shield, inherited style of his parents. The others are faster with spear or bow. Aag is clumsy, mocked as “the lumbering ox.” 
- Small moment: Aag notices Mira laughing at something unrelated, not mockery, but his heart stings.
- Closing beat: Evening. Aag sits by Shaila as she recites myths of the Leela, while Darshan exaggerates stories of his youth. Warmth of hearth, but Aag stares into the fire as though searching for something beyond the mountain walls.

** Ch.2 — Ember Evenings
:FOCUS: Build bond with Mira; deepen grandparents’ influence.
:TONE: Soft, personal, bittersweet foreshadow.
:BEATS:
- Afternoon task: Aag and Mira collect herbs or fetch water. Their banter is natural: she teases his clumsy strength, he shrugs it off with humor borrowed from Darshan.
- Mira reveals her practicality: she worries about her family’s survival, admires the discipline of the Agni-Rakshakas. She hints that stability matters more than dreams.
- Later: Darshan ribs Aag for “making moon-eyes” at Mira; Shaila warns him not to build castles of hope too easily. Both mean well but leave him conflicted.
- Twilight: village gathering. Music, laughter, people preparing for the Festival of Fire. Mira dances with others; Aag watches, caught between yearning and acceptance.
- Echo backdrop: Aag hears faint **Harmonic Whispers** in the mountain wind, like a song he cannot understand. Jyoti stirs restlessly, coils tighter around his wrist.
- Closing beat: Aag lies awake under the stars, imagining a shared life with Mira, picturing himself as protector with sword and shield. It feels real — until morning comes.
