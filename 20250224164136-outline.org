** [[id:firebrands-ascent][Act 1 – Ember Among the Ash]]
*** Born of Fire and Mist
- Setting: Agni-Shikhara, a high volcanic sanctuary in the Spinebreaker Mountains.
- Aag Emberpeak is born into the warrior caste Agni-Rakshakas.
- He trains with them but is more in tune with nature than warfare.
- Companion: [[id:jyoti][Jyoti]], a sacred sentient Nāga, telepathic and hyper-sensory.
- Jyoti can:
  - See through walls
  - Sense threats
  - Recall names/faces across lifetimes
  - Regenerate via shedding
*** The Vision and the Break
- Aag receives a fire vision: a shadow spreading across the land.
- Elders dismiss him.
- Aag leaves his mountain, guided by instinct and a vow to return stronger.
*** Into the World Below
- Aag meets cities, corruption, and cultures disconnected from the earth.
- The world desires the Ten Sacred Species—Aag realizes Jyoti is one of them.
*** The Trial of the Ashen Vanara
- Aag discovers an ancient temple of Agni.
- Faces Bhaskar, an ember-eyed Vanara who can shift size:
  - Grows or shrinks at will
  - Time must balance (large time = small time)
- Aag loses the fight, but his spirit earns Bhaskar’s loyalty.

** [[id:fall-from-flame][Act 2 – Fall from Flame]]
*** The Rising Fire
- Aag becomes a reluctant folk hero through deeds and alliances.
- Combat with Bhaskar becomes legendary.
- He meets [[id:lalei][Lalei]], a sharp, grounded healer-strategist with a mysterious past.
- Their bond grows into love.
*** The Scorching Lie
- Aag is invited to a city of power and betrayed.
- Accused of treason. Lalei is taken. Jyoti is nearly destroyed.
- Bhaskar is cursed—size-shifting locked.
- Aag loses everything.
*** Ashes in the Soil
- Aag escapes into exile and learns from the natural world.
- Befriends animals, spirits, and wild beings.
- Gains wisdom, patience, clarity.
- Begins searching for a way to unbind Bhaskar’s curse.

** [[id:fire-reborn][Act 3 – Fire Reborn]]
*** Breaking the Seal
- Aag returns, seeking the Cursed Crucible to free Bhaskar.
- Success depends on trust and shared purpose.
- Bhaskar is freed and rededicates himself to Aag’s cause.
*** The Kindling Rebellion
- Aag gathers misfits, wildfolk, and oppressed warriors.
- Jyoti returns—now a scout, spy, and spirit-guide.
- They strike with precision, moving like nature: chaotic, overwhelming, pure.
*** Trial of Flame and Soul
- Aag journeys to Mt. Vardhana to rekindle Jyoti’s essence.
- He confronts apathy—the temptation to stop caring.
- Rejects it. Chooses fire, light, and love.
*** The Storm and the Inferno
- Final battle: sacred beasts, machines, tyrants collide.
- Bhaskar shifts in battle—massive, then small, disorienting enemies.
- Aag faces the tyrant—not for vengeance, but balance.

** [[id:return-and-legacy][Act 4 – Return and Legacy]]
*** Peace and Legacy
- Lalei is rescued or honored (TBD).
- Aag returns to Agni-Shikhara not to rule, but to teach and protect.
- Bhaskar chooses to stay as friend, not bound guardian.
- The fire lives on—not just in temples, but in hearts.
