* [[id:firebrands-ascent][Act 1 – Ember Among the Ash]]
:PROPERTIES:
:type: narrative outline
:theme: heartbreak, insignificance, vision, first trial
:END:

** Born of Fire and Mist
- Setting: **Agni-Shikhara**, volcanic peaks in the Spinebreaker Mountains.  
- Aag Emberpeak raised by his **grandparents** after his parents’ death (mystery TBD).  
- Trains with the **Agni-Rakshakas** but never excels; respected for his kindness, not his skill.  
- Villagers see him as dependable but unremarkable — “Aag the helper.”  
- His bond with **Jyoti**, a sacred Nāga:  
  - Telepathic, hyper-sensory, remembers souls.  
  - To Aag: friend and confidant.  
  - To the wider world: a priceless, hunted Spirit-Born.  

** The Heartbreak (Personal Catalyst)
- Aag harbors love for **Mira**, his childhood friend.  
- During a fire festival, Mira chooses another man (an accomplished warrior/craftsman) as her partner.  
- For Mira: practical choice, survival and standing matter more than affection.  
- For Aag: devastating — confirms his fear of being insignificant.  
- He hides his hurt but begins questioning his worth: *“If kindness isn’t enough here, what am I for?”*  

** The Fire Rite and the Vision (World Catalyst)
- Annual sacred rite: villagers meditate before the mountain’s fire to seek omens.  
- Most see personal symbols (good harvest, strong children).  
- Aag sees something unprecedented:  
  - Shadow swallowing the lowlands.  
  - Sacred Species hunted and broken.  
  - The fire itself sputtering into ash.  
- He reports it to the Elders — they dismiss him:  
  - *“Dreams are not truth. The world below is not our concern.”*  
- Rejection deepens his fracture: heartbreak + insignificance + now disbelief.  

** The Decision to Leave
- Aag feels torn:  
  - Mira’s rejection still burns.  
  - Elders dismiss his vision, confirming his irrelevance.  
  - Jyoti whispers: *“The Silence spreads. If you stay, you will wither with it.”*  
- Motivations overlap:  
  - **Petty/juvenile** → heartbreak, pride, desire to prove himself.  
  - **Spiritual instinct** → cannot ignore what he saw in the flames.  
- He decides to leave with Jyoti — not nobly, but restlessly:  
  - *“If I can’t matter here, maybe I’ll matter elsewhere. Maybe I’ll find what the fire showed me.”*  

** Into the World Below
- Aag descends into valleys and riverlands.  
- First encounters with outsiders shock him:  
  - Trade-driven morality, bribes, exploitation.  
  - Compassion treated as weakness.  
- Rumors of **hunters** spread — men seeking Spirit-Born creatures for wealth and power.  
- Aag realizes Jyoti is in grave danger; her presence makes him a target.  
- Jyoti: *“I am not just your friend, Aag. I am one of the Ten. And they will not let us walk in peace.”*  

** The Trial of the Ashen Vanara
- While fleeing hunters, Jyoti leads Aag into an overgrown, half-buried fire temple.  
- Inside waits **Bhaskar, the Ashen Vanara**, ember-eyed guardian bound by oath.  
- Bhaskar declares: *“Only the Firebrand may carry the flame beyond these stones. Prove you are worthy, or perish.”*  
- Combat trial:  
  - Bhaskar grows immense, then shrinks tiny, always balancing time.  
  - Aag is outmatched — bruised, clumsy, desperate.  
  - Yet he refuses to yield, rising again and again.  
- Bhaskar halts:  
  - *“Strength without fire is nothing. Fire without purpose is ash. Yet you rise. Why?”*  
- Aag admits, not nobly:  
  - *“I don’t know. Maybe because if I fall and stay down, then I’ll never matter at all.”*  
- Bhaskar, moved by stubborn will, recognizes the ember within him.  
- He swears loyalty — not to a chosen hero, but to the boy too stubborn to quit.  

** Closing Beat of Act 1
- Aag now walks with two companions:  
  - Jyoti (his tether to the Leela, hunted yet guiding).  
  - Bhaskar (his shield and trial-witness, bound by vow).  
- He does not yet know his grand purpose.  
- But he knows one thing: leaving the mountains was not a mistake.  
- The world outside is broken — and somehow, **he cannot turn back.**

** [[id:fall-from-flame][Act 2 – Fall from Flame]]
*** The Rising Fire
- Aag becomes a reluctant folk hero through deeds and alliances.
- Combat with Bhaskar becomes legendary.
- He meets [[id:lalei][Lalei]], a sharp, grounded healer-strategist with a mysterious past.
- Their bond grows into love.
*** The Scorching Lie
- Aag is invited to a city of power and betrayed.
- Accused of treason. Lalei is taken. Jyoti is nearly destroyed.
- Bhaskar is cursed—size-shifting locked.
- Aag loses everything.
*** Ashes in the Soil
- Aag escapes into exile and learns from the natural world.
- Befriends animals, spirits, and wild beings.
- Gains wisdom, patience, clarity.
- Begins searching for a way to unbind Bhaskar’s curse.

** [[id:fire-reborn][Act 3 – Fire Reborn]]
*** Breaking the Seal
- Aag returns, seeking the Cursed Crucible to free Bhaskar.
- Success depends on trust and shared purpose.
- Bhaskar is freed and rededicates himself to Aag’s cause.
*** The Kindling Rebellion
- Aag gathers misfits, wildfolk, and oppressed warriors.
- Jyoti returns—now a scout, spy, and spirit-guide.
- They strike with precision, moving like nature: chaotic, overwhelming, pure.
*** Trial of Flame and Soul
- Aag journeys to Mt. Vardhana to rekindle Jyoti’s essence.
- He confronts apathy—the temptation to stop caring.
- Rejects it. Chooses fire, light, and love.
*** The Storm and the Inferno
- Final battle: sacred beasts, machines, tyrants collide.
- Bhaskar shifts in battle—massive, then small, disorienting enemies.
- Aag faces the tyrant—not for vengeance, but balance.

** [[id:return-and-legacy][Act 4 – Return and Legacy]]
*** Peace and Legacy
- Lalei is rescued or honored (TBD).
- Aag returns to Agni-Shikhara not to rule, but to teach and protect.
- Bhaskar chooses to stay as friend, not bound guardian.
- The fire lives on—not just in temples, but in hearts.
