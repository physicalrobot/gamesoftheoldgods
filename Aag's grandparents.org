:END:

** Grandmother – Shaila Emberpeak
- **Role:** Cultural memory-keeper, storyteller, moral compass.  
- **Personality:** Stern but warm; pragmatic wisdom softened with deep love.  
- **Traits:**  
  - Knows the old songs and rites of the Agni-Shikhara.  
  - Teaches Aag about the Leela, the Sacred Species, and the fire rites.  
  - Believes kindness and harmony are strength.  
  - Sometimes scolds Aag for being “too soft,” but secretly admires his heart.  
- **Influence on Aag:**  
  - Gave him his reverence for nature and culture.  
  - His belief that compassion matters comes from her.  
  - His naivety is partly inherited from her idealism.  
- **Narrative Function:**  
  - The **anchor to tradition.** She makes Aag a child of the old ways.  
  - When Aag’s vision comes, she *wants* to believe but is bound by the Elders’ consensus — her silence hurts him.

** Grandfather – Darshan Emberpeak
- **Role:** Storyteller, craftsman, humorist, worker.  
- **Personality:** Joking, lighthearted, teasing, yet dependable.  
- **Traits:**  
  - Works tirelessly — repairing huts, farming, hauling wood.  
  - Believes laughter makes work easier and bonds stronger.  
  - Loves to tell exaggerated stories (some true, most embellished).  
  - Pretends to be lazy, but is the first to rise when help is needed.  
- **Influence on Aag:**  
  - Instilled his **work ethic** and belief in helping others.  
  - Aag’s tendency to get back up after being beaten down (e.g., in Bhaskar’s trial) comes directly from Darshan’s example.  
  - His humor and simplicity are reflections of his grandfather’s teachings.  
- **Narrative Function:**  
  - The **anchor to humanity.** Darshan makes Aag relatable, flawed, and down-to-earth.  
  - His humor contrasts Shaila’s seriousness and keeps Aag balanced.

** Their Dynamic
- Shaila = strict wisdom / cultural tradition.  
- Darshan = humor / work ethic.  
- Together, they raise Aag with **values both lofty and humble**.  
- Aag’s entire personality is their fusion:  
  - The naive compassion of Shaila.  
  - The stubborn work ethic and humor of Darshan.  

---

** Narrative Role in Aag’s Story
- They **explain why Aag is different** from the rest of the world.  
- They also explain why the Elders’ rejection of his vision hurts more — because even *his grandmother*, who filled him with myth and truth, doesn’t fully stand with him.  
- They give the audience a reason to *love Aag before the world breaks him.*
