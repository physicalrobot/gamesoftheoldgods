* Aag Emberpeak – Personal Story Roots
:PROPERTIES:
:type: character arc seed
:theme: heartbreak, insignificance, naivety
:END:

** Orphaned Childhood
- Parents died when he was young (cause TBD: disease, accident, or war beyond the mountains).  
- Raised by grandparents, keepers of old rituals and stories of the Leela.  
- His worldview is shaped by them:
  - Compassion is strength.  
  - Simplicity is purity.  
  - Harmony is more important than ambition.  
- This makes him beloved but underestimated in the village — he’s “good” but never considered “great.”  

---

** The Heartbreak (Catalyst)
- **Mira** (placeholder name) — his childhood friend and quiet love.  
  - They grew up together, shared laughter, firelight stories, long walks by rivers.  
  - Aag assumed (without ever saying aloud) that this bond would one day become love.  
- Mira, however, desires a life of *security and recognition*.  
  - She chooses another man — an Agni-Rakshaka warrior, disciplined and ambitious.  
  - For her, this is practical: a partner who can provide, protect, and give her standing.  
  - She still cares for Aag, but sees him as someone “too good-hearted, too simple” to survive in the world as it is.

** Why It Breaks Him
- For Aag, Mira’s choice is more than rejection:
  - It confirms what he’s always feared — that **kindness and simplicity are invisible** in a world that values power.  
  - It collides with his grandparents’ teachings — *if compassion is strength, why is it never enough?*  
  - He feels not just unloved, but insignificant, a background figure in his own story.  
- This festers into restless angst: *“If I can’t matter here, then maybe I can matter elsewhere.”*  

---

** The Decision to Leave
- Fueled by heartbreak + disillusionment, Aag decides to leave the mountains.  
- On the surface: a juvenile escape, a desire to prove Mira (and the village) wrong.  
- Deeper level: a man running from insignificance, aching to *find meaning where he feels none exists.*  
- He confides only in Jyoti:  
  - *“They say the world is bigger than the mountains. Maybe out there, there’s a place where I’m not just… nothing.”*  
- This small, bitter ember of heartbreak becomes the **spark of his grand mythic journey**.
