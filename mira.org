* Mira of Agni-Shikhara
:PROPERTIES:
:type: character profile
:role: love interest (catalyst)
:theme: pragmatism vs idealism
:END:

** Background
- Childhood friend of Aag — they grew up together under the same mountains.  
- Practical, hardworking, with a clear head for survival.  
- Raised by a family that believed *strength and provision are the only guarantees in a hard world.*  

---

** Personality
- **Practical:** Values stability, protection, and tangible results over dreams or ideals.  
- **Caring but firm:** She genuinely likes Aag and admires his kindness, but thinks he’s naïve.  
- **Grounded:** Believes love cannot survive without security — and chooses accordingly.  
- **Conflict:** Torn between affection for Aag’s goodness and her belief that goodness alone won’t keep her (or her future family) safe.  

---

** The Choice
- When choosing a partner, she picks an Agni-Rakshaka warrior (or skilled craftsman/leader) instead of Aag.  
- For Mira, this is not cruelty but *pragmatism*:  
  - She wants a family, safety, standing.  
  - Aag is kind, but lacks ambition and worldly sense.  
- To Aag, this feels like betrayal of everything his grandparents taught him: that compassion and harmony are enough.  
- To Mira, it is simply reality: *“The world is harsh, Aag. Kindness doesn’t put food on the table.”*  

---

** Why She Matters
- Mira is Aag’s first **collision with the Silence**:  
  - He believes goodness matters most.  
  - She believes survival and status matter most.  
  - Neither is “wrong” — but the clash cracks his world open.  
- She catalyzes his decision to leave — his heartbreak is the ember that starts the fire.

** Role in Later Story (Optional Reappearance)
1. **Symbol of the Past (Act 2 or 3)**  
   - Aag might encounter Mira years later.  
   - She could be thriving (showing the path he *didn’t* take), or struggling under the world’s dissonance.  
   - This forces him to confront his original wound and measure how far he’s grown.  

2. **Foil Character**  
   - Mira remains pragmatic while Aag evolves into the harmonizer.  
   - Their dialogue can highlight the story’s central tension: survival vs harmony, self vs community.  

3. **Human Face of the Silence**  
   - Mira isn’t evil — she’s just a product of a world out of tune.  
   - This reinforces the theme that people aren’t bad in themselves; the Silence corrupts priorities.  

---

** Emotional Function
- For Aag:  
  - She makes his heartbreak *real and human*.  
  - She forces him to realize that **being kind is not the same as being significant.**  
- For the Reader:  
  - She embodies the *practical, survivalist morality* that most people accept in this broken world.  
  - Her choice stings because it’s understandable, not villainous.
