* Spirit-Born Lineage Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:type: rarity reference
:END:

- **Nāga (Jyoti’s kind):** Most hunted — scales, regeneration, memory-soul ability commodified.  
- **Ashen Vanara (Bhaskar’s kind):** Rare, feared, dismissed as myth; powers not transferable → less hunted.  
- **Kamadhenu:** Actively hunted for essence of life/healing.  
- **Deer (Rohini):** Hunted as cursed or holy, often slain out of fear.  
- **Garuda:** Revered but feared; visions too destabilizing.  
- **Lion/Tiger:** Symbol of justice once; now feared by rulers who hate truth.  
- **Hamsa:** Shunned — veilbreaking brings fear of spirits.  
- **Kurma:** Considered extinct; mythic tortoise hidden beneath realms.  
- **Airavata:** Fisher songs survive; empires dismiss as fable.  
- **Nandi:** Oath-bull cults destroyed by coastal Dominion; reduced to fragments.
