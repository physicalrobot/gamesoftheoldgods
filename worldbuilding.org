* The Birth of Reality: The Leela
:PROPERTIES:
:origin: metaphysical vibration
:cosmic_force: Para-Brahman
:END:

- In the beginning, there was only the **Para-Brahman**, the infinite, unmanifest cosmic consciousness.
- Through an act of intent—not necessity—the Para-Brahman initiated the **Leela**: a divine play, a rhythmic, intentional manifestation of **vibration, resonance, and sacred sound**.
- From this act came **existence itself**—not chaotic, but a precise **harmonic ecosystem**, where all beings are tones in a greater symphony.
- This “Leela” wasn’t meant to dominate or conquer—it was meant to **experience**, to explore itself through **matter, spirit, and myth**.

* The Three Tiers of Life
:PROPERTIES:
:tier_1: Mundane Life
:tier_2: Sentient Races
:tier_3: Mystical Beings
:END:

** Tier I – Mundane Life
- Animals, plants, fungi, microbes—biological life that evolves naturally.
- Includes regular snakes, cows, eagles, deer, etc.
- Some species may possess slight spiritual resonance but lack sentience or divine connection.

** Tier II – Sentient Races (Human-Adjacent)
- Races capable of language, culture, craft, and spiritual understanding.
- Includes:
  - Humans
  - Vanaras (Simian folk, spiritual cousins to Hanuman)
  - Nagin (serpent-blooded humanoids, not full Nāga)
  - Garudans (avian people, inspired by Garuda but distinct from the true being)
- Some of these races **revere** the Tier III beings as gods or ancestors.
- Capable of spiritual growth, but not inherently divine.

** Tier III – The Ten Sacred Species (Spirit-Born)
:PROPERTIES:
:rarity: One species per type
:traits: Sentient, spiritually resonant, hyper-aware
:origin: Born directly from Leela’s vibration
:END:

- These beings are **living embodiments of primal forces**—each born directly from the harmonic echo of the Leela.
- Not just rare—they are **unique spiritual lineages** within specific animal forms.
- Each sacred species contains only **one true spiritual bloodline**—all others are biological mimics.
- Each sacred being is:
  - Sentient and capable of **telepathy**
  - Possesses a **hyper-sensory trait**
  - Symbolizes a core aspect of the Leela
  - Often targeted, revered, or misunderstood

* Humans and Their Role
:PROPERTIES:
:species: Human
:potential: Mid
:relationship_to_mystics: Varies (fear, reverence, exploitation)
:END:

- Humans are **spiritually neutral**, neither divine nor debased.
- What sets them apart is their **potential for transformation**.
- Some revere the sacred species as avatars or gods. Others try to hunt or control them.
- Most humans are unaware of the **Leela’s truth**—they live disconnected from the source rhythm.
