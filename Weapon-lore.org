* Aag’s Martial Growth Across Acts
:PROPERTIES:
:type: character arc
:theme: weapon mastery, family legacy
:END:

** Act 1 – The Awkward Firebrand
- **Training Roots:**  
  - Aag trains with bows and spears but lacks precision.  
  - With heavy sword and shield, he is clumsy, often overextended.  
  - Others mock him: *“You fight like a lumbering ox.”*  
- **Family Echo:**  
  - He clings to his parents’ style out of stubborn loyalty, not because he excels at it.  
  - Grandfather encourages: *“Keep lifting, boy. Fire takes time to grow.”*  
- **Combat Moments:**  
  - Wins sparring not by skill but by refusing to stay down.  
  - In Bhaskar’s trial, the oversized sword slows him down — he loses, but his stubborn will impresses the Vanara.  
- **Emotional Parallel:**  
  - Just like in love (Mira) and with the Elders, he feels “not enough.”  
  - His weapons feel too heavy — just like the life he doesn’t know how to carry.

** Act 2 – Fire Tempered by Struggle
- **The Sword of Forgotten Flame:**  
  - Found in the temple. Still feels like a burden — too big, too heavy, too storied for him.  
  - He wields it defensively, using weight to block, not cut.  
- **The Skullshield of Rakshasa:**  
  - Earned after a fight with allies against a Rakshasa.  
  - Shield reforged from its skull, blessed with fire rites.  
  - Symbol of his mother’s legacy — to guard others at all costs.  
- **Combat Moments:**  
  - With shield, he finally protects others effectively — his first true “tank” moment.  
  - Learns to use sword + shield together: not elegant, but unmovable.  
  - Begins to realize: his fighting style works **with allies** — Bhaskar darting in/out, Jyoti warning of danger.  
- **Emotional Parallel:**  
  - Starts seeing his flaws as strengths.  
  - His weapons don’t make sense alone, just as his life doesn’t — but with others, they’re unstoppable.

** Act 3 – Embodying the Legacy
- **Mastery of Resilience:**  
  - Sword and shield no longer feel oversized — they feel like extensions of him.  
  - He plants his feet like his father, shields others like his mother, rises like his grandfather.  
- **Combat Moments:**  
  - Leads in rebellion battles — not as a flashy warrior, but as the **wall that doesn’t break.**  
  - Sword sears corruption, shield absorbs curses.  
- **Emotional Parallel:**  
  - Accepts he doesn’t need Mira’s validation or Elders’ approval.  
  - Realizes his parents’ style wasn’t about “skill,” but about **purpose.**  
  - His stubborn, tanky resilience is exactly what the Echo needs.

** Act 4 – The Flame Realized
- **The Sword of Forgotten Flame awakens fully** in the final battle.  
  - Not just heavy steel, but a beacon — igniting allies’ courage, searing enemies of the Leela.  
- **The Skullshield becomes a bulwark** — absorbing the antagonist’s corruption, holding back forces no single man should.  
- Aag becomes **the embodiment of his style**:  
  - Shield for his people.  
  - Sword of the Echo.  
  - Not alone, but carrying the fire with all his companions.
