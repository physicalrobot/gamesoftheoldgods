:PROPERTIES:
:type: endgame sketch
:theme: layered villainy, harmony vs silence
:END:

** Setting
- Tyrant’s coastal citadel of iron and black stone.  
- Built on a desecrated Leela temple; storms and seas move out of rhythm.  
- The Silence is strongest here — the world feels wrong.  

---

** Antagonists
- **Human Tyrant** → embodies Silence, enslaving Sacred Species, forging dominion.  
- **Hunter Nemesis** → tied to Aag’s parents’ deaths, relentless pursuer of Jyoti.  
- **The Dissonant Force** → cosmic disharmony, manifesting as broken chord and whispering presence.  

---

** Protagonist’s Side
- **Aag** → sword, shield, guitar, drum.  
- **Jyoti** → tether to Leela, near death but guiding.  
- **Bhaskar** → free of curse, battle-strategist, size-shifting.  
- **Lalei + rebels** → wildfolk, outcasts, beasts.  
- **Freed Sacred Species** → 1–2 others arrive to aid.  

---

** Battle Stages
*** Stage 1 – Clash of Armies
- Rebel host storms the citadel.  
- Bhaskar leads charge; size-shifting turns tide.  
- Aag anchors line with oversized shield, protects allies.  
- Drum + guitar provide cadence, coordination → music turns chaos into harmony.  

*** Stage 2 – Duel with the Hunter
- Aag confronts Nemesis.  
- Revelation: Nemesis led the raid that killed Aag’s parents.  
- Fight: Nemesis is faster, deadlier, but Aag refuses to break.  
- Resolution: Nemesis disarmed or consumed by Silence — not slain in vengeance.  

*** Stage 3 – The Tyrant and the Ritual
- Tyrant has chained Sacred Species, draining their gifts.  
- Uses corrupted echoes to warp battlefield.  
- Aag cuts bindings with sword, blocks curses with shield.  
- Jyoti weakens, tether stretched to breaking.  

*** Stage 4 – The Dissonant Force Revealed
- Silence manifests fully — broken chord given form.  
- Aag cannot fight it with force.  

*** Stage 5 – Chorus of the Echo
- Aag beats drum, strums guitar in sync with Jyoti’s pulse.  
- Bhaskar roars in rhythm.  
- Allies, rebels, Sacred Species join → battlefield becomes a **chorus**.  
- Broken chord retuned into harmony.  
- Silence collapses back into balance.  

---

** Resolution
- Tyrant falls; citadel crumbles into the sea.  
- Sacred Species freed; first step toward their reemergence.  
- Aag battered, gear cracked, instruments scorched — but alive.  
- He has not slain evil but **restored the rhythm**.  
- The Echo begins — the world breathes again.  

---

** Thematic Payoff
- **Sword + Shield:** parents’ legacy — strength and protection.  
- **Guitar + Drum:** grandparents’ legacy — rhythm and harmony.  
- **Jyoti:** tether to Leela.  
- **Bhaskar:** trial-witness, loyalty earned.  
- **Aag:** ember that refused to die → spark of the Echo.
