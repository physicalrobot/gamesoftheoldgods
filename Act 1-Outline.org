:END:

** Ch.1 — Ash and Morning Light
- Daily rhythms of Agni-Shikhara; hearth smoke, volcanic glow.  
- Aag with Grandfather **Darshan** — chores + humor, “lazy bones” banter.  
- Evening with Grandmother **Shaila** — old Leela myths, reverence for tradition.  
- Aag feels loved but underestimated, gazes beyond the mountains.  

---

** Ch.2 — Ox and Ember (Training Style)
- Training yard: Aag insists on greatsword + shield (parents’ legacy).  
- Mocked as “oxen,” clumsy, awkward; peers excel with spears/bows.  
- Darshan reframes: *“Oxen plow the world.”*  
- Shaila recalls parents’ valor, gives weight to Aag’s choice.  
- Jyoti subtly present, watching, balancing, sensing.  
- Aag isn’t graceful — but we glimpse resilience.  

---

** Ch.3 — Ember Evenings
- Aag and **Mira** fetch water/herbs; playful banter, soft teasing.  
- Mira reveals her practicality: admires discipline, wants stability.  
- Aag misreads closeness as inevitability; Mira sees only friendship/comfort.  
- Jyoti coils tighter when Mira speaks of ambition — subtle foreshadow.  
- Echo foreshadow: faint **Harmonic Whispers** in the mountain wind.  
- Closing: Aag lies awake, imagining a future with Mira.  

---

** Ch.4 — Festival of Fire
- Color, music, sacred fire rites.  
- Pairing ceremony: Mira chooses another warrior/craftsman.

- That night: Aag dreams of shadow swallowing lowlands, sacred eyes watching.  
- Wakes with ash dust on palms.  

---

** Ch.5 — The Fire Rite
- Volcano’s sacred chamber; villagers seek personal omens.  
- Aag’s vision: Sacred Species hunted, fire sputtering into ash.  
- Elders dismiss him: *“Dreams are not truth; the world below is not our concern.”*  
- Shaila wants to believe, but stays silent, bound by consensus.  
- Aag feels utterly abandoned.  
- Echo backdrop: embers pulse strangely, faint **Awakening of Resonance.**  
- Alone, Aag hears Jyoti whisper: *“The Silence spreads. If you stay, you will wither with it.”*  

---

** Ch.6 — The Pack and the Parting
- Aag wrestles with heartbreak + rejection; Darshan advises: *“Walk toward something, not away.”*  
- Shaila gifts prayer-cloth (family sigil), but cannot oppose the Elders.  
- Aag’s choice is messy: part pride, part pain, part instinct from the vision.  
- Quiet farewell: Jyoti coils like a vow.  
- Aag descends the switchbacks at dawn — not as a hero, but as a restless, wounded man.  

---

** Ch.7 — River Dust and Crooked Smiles
- First descent into valleys and trade roads.  
- Bustle of barter, bribes, exploitation — kindness seen as weakness.  
- Rumors of Spirit-Born bounties: *“a serpent that remembers souls.”*  
- Aag realizes Jyoti makes him a target.  

---

** Ch.8 — Teeth in the Reeds
- Ambush at river ford by hunters.  
- Aag fights badly but bravely — oversized gear shields Jyoti more than it strikes.  
- With Jyoti’s foresight, they narrowly escape.  
- Aag realizes he cannot protect Jyoti alone.  

---

** Ch.9 — The Ashen Door
- Jyoti leads him to an overgrown fire temple, glyphs glowing at his touch.  
- *“Within sleeps a guardian of vows. If we enter, we must be judged.”*  
- Despite wounds and humiliation, Aag chooses to enter — desperate for strength.  

---

** Ch.10 — Trial of the Ashen Vanara
- **Bhaskar** awakens; ember-flecked, size-shifting.  
- Aag is tossed, battered, humiliated — but rises again and again.  
- When asked *“Why rise?”*, Aag admits: *“If I stay down, I stay no one.”*  
- Bhaskar bows: *“You are not yet purpose — but you are fire.”*  
- Swears loyalty — not to prophecy, but to Aag’s unyielding will.  

---

** Ch.11 — Closing Beat
- Aag now walks with:  
  - Jyoti — Leela’s tether, hunted, guiding.  
  - Bhaskar — trial-witness, protector.  
- No grand purpose yet, but leaving was not a mistake.  
- Act 1 ends: hunted, unready, but no longer alone.
