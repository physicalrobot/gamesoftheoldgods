:PROPERTIES:
:type: narrative arc
:theme: heartbreak, insignificance, vision, first trial
:END:

** Ch.1 — Ash and Morning Light
- Daily rhythms of Agni-Shikhara.  
- Aag with **Darshan** (grandfather): chores, joking, Darshan insists on laughter even in work.  
- Darshan encourages Aag to bring his **little traveling guitar** when working — “a tune makes the bucket lighter.”  
- Evening: **Shaila** (grandmother) shares Leela myths; Aag clumsily strums along, half-jokingly turning her chants into melody.  
- Jyoti coils nearby, eyes flickering when certain chords land — hinting that music has deeper resonance.  

---

** Ch.2 — Ox and Ember (Training Style)
- Training yard: Aag insists on greatsword + shield (parents’ legacy).  
- He’s mocked for clumsiness, nicknamed “oxen.”  
- Darshan reframes: *“Oxen plow the world.”*  
- Shaila recalls parents’ legacy → gives dignity to his choice.  
- That night, Aag practices on his **skull-drum**, tapping out rhythms. Jyoti reacts oddly, as though sensing danger in the beat.  
- Foreshadow: his “music hobby” is tied to the world’s hidden pulse.  

---

** Ch.3 — Ember Evenings
- Aag and **Mira** fetch water/herbs; playful banter, teasing, hints of warmth.  
- She teases him for carrying his guitar everywhere — *“You’ll never charm a deer into following you, Aag.”*  
- He plays her a clumsy song anyway, earnest and heartfelt. She laughs but doesn’t take it as romance.  
- Mira reveals her practicality: admires warriors with discipline, seeks stability. Aag interprets her care as closeness.  
- Echo foreshadow: faint **Harmonic Whispers** in mountain wind; Aag strums absentmindedly and the rhythm aligns with it.  
- Closing: Aag lies awake, practicing a song for Mira that he’ll never get to play at the festival.  

---

** Ch.4 — Festival of Fire
- Celebration: food, dance, music. Aag joins with his guitar, contributing clumsy joy.  
- Mira dances with others; eventually chooses another warrior/craftsman in pairing rite.  
- Aag hides humiliation, Darshan tries humor, Shaila looks pained.  
- At festival’s close, Aag beats his drum quietly, alone, heartbeat echoing his ache.  
- Night: dream of shadows swallowing lowlands, Sacred Species hunted, sacred fire sputtering to ash.  
- He wakes with ash on his palms — the first real omen.  

---

** Ch.5 — The Fire Rite
- Volcano’s sacred chamber; villagers seek personal omens.  
- Aag’s vision: lowlands engulfed, Sacred Species hunted, fire sputtering into ash.  
- Elders dismiss him: *“Dreams are not truth; the world below is not our concern.”*  
- Shaila stays silent, torn.  
- Embers pulse strangely (Echo sign).  
- In despair, Aag plays a soft tune on his guitar by the dying fire. Jyoti whispers: *“The Silence spreads. If you stay, you will wither with it.”*  

---

** Ch.6 — The Pack and the Parting
- Aag struggles with rejection and humiliation.  
- Darshan: *“Walk toward something, not away.”*  
- Shaila gifts him a **prayer-cloth** (family sigil).  
- Aag takes sword, shield, guitar, and drum — mocking himself: *“Too much to carry for a boy who can’t even win a spar.”*  
- Farewell: Jyoti coils like a vow.  
- He descends the mountain at dawn, music and weapons both heavy.  

---

** Ch.7 — River Dust and Crooked Smiles
- First descent into valleys, trade roads.  
- Bustling barter, bribes, exploitation — kindness treated as weakness.  
- Street performers with crude instruments mock Aag’s guitar.  
- Rumors of Spirit-Born bounties: *“a serpent that remembers souls.”*  
- Aag realizes Jyoti makes him a target.  

---

** Ch.8 — Teeth in the Reeds
- Ambush at river ford by hunters.  
- Aag fights badly but bravely — oversized gear shields Jyoti more than strikes.  
- In desperation, he beats his drum to rally himself; the rhythm throws off the hunters’ timing.  
- They escape narrowly, battered. Aag realizes: he cannot protect Jyoti alone.  

---

** Ch.9 — The Ashen Door
- Jyoti leads him to an overgrown fire temple, glyphs glowing at his touch.  
- His guitar hums faintly, strings vibrating without being plucked — resonance with the temple.  
- *“Within sleeps a guardian of vows. If we enter, we must be judged.”*  
- Despite wounds, Aag chooses to enter.  

---

** Ch.10 — Trial of the Ashen Vanara
- **Bhaskar** awakens, ember-eyed.  
- Trial: Aag is battered and humiliated, sword and shield feel too heavy.  
- He rises again and again, stubborn.  
- When asked *“Why rise?”*, Aag admits: *“If I stay down, I stay no one.”*  
- Bhaskar bows: *“You are not yet purpose — but you are fire.”*  
- Vows to follow.  

---

** Ch.11 — Closing Beat
- Aag now walks with:  
  - Jyoti (Leela’s tether, hunted).  
  - Bhaskar (trial-witness, protector).  
- Sword + Shield = parents’ legacy.  
- Guitar + Drum = grandparents’ gifts, foreshadowing his cosmic role as resonator.  
- No grand purpose yet — but leaving was not a mistake.  
- Act 1 ends with the trio stepping into the wider world, hunted but not alone.
