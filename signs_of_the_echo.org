#+title: Signs of the Echo

The Echo does not arrive in one instant — it builds, like a drumbeat in the distance.
These signs appear in no fixed order, but each one strengthens the world’s connection to the Leela.

---

** Stage 1 — Subtle Murmurs (Unnoticed by most)
1. **Harmonic Whispers**
   - Sensitive individuals hear faint, layered tones in moments of deep quiet.
   - Sounds like wind through a hollow bone or the distant hum of a conch shell.
   - Easily mistaken for tinnitus or imagination.

2. **Dream Crossings**
   - Tier 2 beings dream of vast, symbolic landscapes they’ve never seen.
   - Sometimes awaken with minor physical traces — sand, petals, ash — on their body.

3. **Awakening of Lesser Resonance**
   - Common animals exhibit unusual empathy or intelligence for brief moments.
   - Crops grow slightly faster in certain moon phases.
   - Nothing yet ties it to the Sacred Species.

** Stage 2 — Visible Anomalies (Ignored by the powerful)
4. **Pulse of the Land**
   - Rivers flow against the current for minutes at a time.
   - Trees sway with no wind, leaves turning to face a fixed point in the sky.

5. **Bond Sparks**
   - The first Attunements between Tier 2 and Tier 3 beings occur naturally, without ritual.
   - Minor gifts manifest: heightened senses, brief flashes of intuition.

6. **Veil Fractures**
   - Momentary overlaps between the mortal and spirit realms occur in small areas.
   - Ghost animals, spectral lights, voices without source.
   - Few last longer than heartbeats.

** Stage 3 — Unmistakable Phenomena (Feared or exploited)
7. **The Unveiling**
   - Hidden structures, temples, and song-caves emerge from earth, water, or mist.
   - Glyphs in forgotten tongues begin glowing faintly when touched.

8. **Living Songs**
   - Certain chants, flutes, or bells trigger impossible effects:
     - Shadows forming patterns
     - Stones moving to create paths
     - Short bursts of rainfall in clear skies

9. **The Great Stirring**
   - Some Sacred Species awaken from centuries-long slumber, though not all are benevolent.
   - Rumors spread, creating political panic and opportunism.

---

** Stage 4 — The Convergence (No longer deniable)
10. **Harmonic Storms**
    - Storms carry rhythm in their thunder, patterns in their lightning.
    - Prolonged exposure alters perception, triggering visions or madness.

11. **Chorus of the First Chord**
    - Multiple Sacred Species resonate in harmony, audible for miles.
    - Causes every bonded Tier 2 to temporarily feel the full weight of their partner’s gift.

12. **The Flame’s First Light**
    - A single, catalytic event reignites the Leela’s melody in the mortal realm.
    - The world’s rhythm shifts instantly — some rejoice, others resist.
    - This is the moment the Echo can no longer be stopped.
